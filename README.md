# SimpleFlaskServer
This is a recreational project that has been written to learn Python3 and the Flask Framework.
- It is worth noting that this server has not functional use and is just a display of functionality at this point in time.
- I have written the code for this project trying to follow how I have seen code written in Python on the internet, Although I think in many ways in this Repo I have defaulted to ways of writing code that I have seen done in Java and therefore I think are probably the incorrect way to write Python.

Future work
- Double check the Repo and conform to a Python standard coding practice
- Finish Unit Tests
- Complete Integration Test/Tests
- Look into the correct usage of modules
- Implement Security Keys/Secrets
- Look into patching and correct unit testing
