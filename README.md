# SimpleFlaskServer
This project has been written to learn the Flask Framework.
- I have written the code for this project trying to follow how I have seen code written in Python on the internet, Although I think in many ways in this code I have defaulted to ways of writing code that I have seen done in Java and therefore I think are probably the incorrect way to write Python.

Future work
- Double check the Repo and conform a Python standard coding practice
- Finish Unit Tests
- Complete Integration Test/Tests
